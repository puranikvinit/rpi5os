This text file contains the changes/additions to the config.txt file of the pi5 to get this kernel running.


To enable 64-bit mode for the processor.
arm_64bit=1

By default, the PCIe X4 interface is reset before loading the kernel so that the PCIe RC is in a clean state.
Hence, to avoid the PCIe translations to the register addresses specified in the source from the AP, disable the reset.
pciex4_reset=0

Required for JTAG debugging, with OpenOCD and LLDB
enable_jtag_gpio=1
